              My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
            </h1>
            <p>
              I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that
              I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it
              because there was too much. Things were terrible. I had a job that
              I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold
              a relationship.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subtitle">How I turned things around</h3>
            <p>
              I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. I
              literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place
              and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. It wasn't
              easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I
              didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
            </p>

          <h3 class="subtitle">Now I live the simple life</h3>
          <p>
            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm
            less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time
            to enjoy. With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had
            no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can
            benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started
            this site!
